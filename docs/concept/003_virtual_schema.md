# Virtual Schema: A Framework for NFT Schema Integration

## Purpose
The Virtual Schema system enables interoperability between two or more NFT schemas, allowing them to interact and share attributes. This is particularly useful when schemas share the same user base and need synchronized functionality.

## Example Scenario
Consider a scenario where a user owns tokens across different schemas (e.g., Token 1 in Schema A and Token 5 in Schema B). The goals are to:

- Create interactions between these schemas where actions in one schema affect token values in both
- Enable attribute sharing across schemas
- Maintain synchronized user benefits across multiple schemas

## Implementation Process

### 1. Proposal and Security
The process begins with a proposal for a Virtual Schema, requiring an initial asset lock as an anti-spam measure.

### 2. Action Definition
The Virtual Schema creator defines the cross-schema action relationships and interactions.

### 3. Owner Decision Period
Original Schema owners must decide on the proposal within a 3-day window:
- They can either accept or reject the integration
- Failure to respond results in a 30% penalty on the locked assets
- This incentivizes active participation in the decision-making process
- Owners can specify which attributes from their schema can participate in the integration
- Virtual Schema will have limited access, only to the explicitly permitted attributes

### 4. Expiration and Asset Return
The Virtual Schema becomes invalid after the expiration period, and locked assets are returned to their owners.

## Attribute Access Control
Schema owners maintain control over their data by:
- Selectively choosing which attributes can be accessed by the Virtual Schema
- Restricting access to sensitive or private attributes
- Maintaining sovereignty over their schema's core functionality

## Conclusion
This structure ensures secure and managed integration of multiple NFT schemas while maintaining owner control over their schema's interactions and data access.
