# SIX Protocol Chain Information

SIX Protocol is a blockchain infrastructure that has been designed for real-world businesses built on Cosmos SDK and has been upgraded to support the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), offering new opportunities for users to create decentralized applications (dApps).


## What is Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)?
The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a decentralized software platform that serves as a virtual computer, enabling developers to create dApps and deploy smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. As a processing engine, the EVM is responsible for determining the state of every block in the blockchain and adds an extra layer of functionality due to its smart contract capabilities.The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is responsible for executing smart contracts and maintaining the state of the Ethereum blockchain. It is a key component of the Ethereum protocol and is the environment in which all Ethereum accounts and smart contracts live. At any given block in the chain, Ethereum has one and only one 'canonical' state, and the EVM is what defines the rules for computing a new valid state from block to block. The EVM is a stack-based machine that executes bytecode instructions, and it is implemented on top of the Ethereum network by all Ethereum clients, including the Ethereum execution clients and standalone implementations in various programming languages.

## Benefits of EVM support for SIX Protocol
SIX Protocol’s EVM support offers a range of benefits. Here are some of the key advantages:
1. Fast transactions: With SIX Protocol’s EVM support, transactions can be processed quickly and efficiently, ensuring a smooth user experience.
2. Decentralization: SIX Protocol is a decentralized blockchain platform, meaning that it is not controlled by a single entity. This ensures greater transparency, security, and trust in the network.
3. Low transaction fees: Compared to other blockchain platforms, SIX Protocol offers relatively cheaper transaction fees, making it an affordable option for developers and businesses.
4. Easy access to builders: SIX Protocol offers easy access to our in-house builder, providing developers and businesses with the support they need to create and deploy their dApps quickly and efficiently.
5. Security and trustworthiness: SIX Protocol’s focus on security and trust ensures that the network is safe and reliable, giving users peace of mind when using the platform.

By leveraging the benefits of SIX Protocol’s EVM support, developers and businesses can unlock a world of new possibilities and tap into the full potential of the blockchain.
